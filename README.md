# 🔮 Kubernetes Failure Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **predicting failures in Kubernetes clusters** using machine learning models.  
It leverages **pod-level metrics** and applies algorithms such as **Random Forest** and **LSTM** to detect anomalies and forecast potential failures in containerized environments.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze Kubernetes pod metrics data.
- Train ML models (**Random Forest, LSTM**) to predict failures.
- Compare model performance for accuracy and reliability.
- Provide insights to improve **system reliability and proactive failure management**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python
- **ML Frameworks:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Models:** Random Forest, LSTM
- **Data:** Kubernetes pod metrics (CSV)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment (future scope):** Containerization + monitoring integration

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (`modified_pod_metrics.csv`) contains time-series metrics collected from Kubernetes pods, including resource usage and performance indicators.
